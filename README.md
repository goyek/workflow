## Description

`workflow` is an example of a reusable, yet customizable, `goyek` workflow
that could be used to share common build pipeline code.

It defines reusable tasks, stages and configures the `goyek.DefaultFlow`
to use common flags, middlewares, printing.

You can find example usage (and customization) in <https://github.com/goyek/demo>.

## Build Pipeline

The default `all` build pipeline consists of following stages:

- `init`
- `build`
- `test`

### Stages

The `init` stage consists of following tasks:

- `go-tidy`
- `go-generate`

The `build` stage consists of following tasks:

- `go-build`

The `test` stage consists of following tasks:

- `go-vet`
- `go-test`

## Additional Tasks

`clean` tasks is used to clean the workspace from files created during build pipeline.

`git-diff` is used to detect if there were changes (e.g. done by `go generate`)
that were not commited.
