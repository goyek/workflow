## Description

`workflow` is an example of a reusable, yet customizable, `goyek` workflow
that could be used to share common build pipeline code.

It defines reusable tasks, stages and configures the `goyek.DefaultFlow`
to use common flags, middlewares, printing.

You can find example usage in <https://github.com/goyek/demo>.
